## Tools List

### 1. `check_gpu.py`
- **Function**: Check GPU information  
- **Purpose**: Quickly see if the system has available GPUs, CUDA version, device count, etc.

### 2. `data_augmentation.py`
- **Function**: Simple random image augmentation  
- **Purpose**: Perform random rotations, flips, scaling, and other operations on training data to improve model generalization.

### 3. `image_merge.py`
- **Function**: Merge multiple images into one complete image  
- **Purpose**: Easily combine multiple small images into a grid or a single large image for visualization or reporting.

### 4. `download_kaggle_dataset.py`
- **Function**: Download datasets directly from Kaggle  
- **Purpose**: Quickly pull datasets from Kaggle without manually downloading them.

### 5. `rename.py`
- **Function**: Batch rename files  
- **Purpose**: Standardize or modify filenames in bulk for datasets or images, improving file management efficiency.
